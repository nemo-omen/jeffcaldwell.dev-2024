A web developer who recently earned his degree in computer science has more to offer than technical know-how â€” he brings years of journalism experience to make code tell stories.

Jeff Caldwell spent years honing his communication skills as a journalist. He spent his days in the newsroom chasing down leads and crafting stories, but that's not all, he went to school for computer science at the same time. He says this mixture of code and communication allows him to bring a different kind of insight into the world of bits and bytes.

"I think creating applications and telling stories share a lot in common," said Caldwell. "Whether you're making something for a user or a reader, you need to present the right information so they understand what's happening."

Caldwell spent the last few years of his degree creating projects with other students, some of them for clients who worked with NASA. He said the experience helped him understand how important communication can be when building a complex project.

"Our team made an application that helped NASA contractors optimize their shipments to the International Space Station. I became the team leader because I not only have experience managing teams in the newsroom, but I also understand how to talk to shareholders and subject-matter experts," said Caldwell. "Being able to get the important details from the client was critical to our project, but being able to communicate effectively with my team is what ultimately made the whole thing a success."
